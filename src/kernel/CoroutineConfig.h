/// @brief The integer type to use of coroutine IDs.  This must be an unsigned

/// @brief The integer value to use to indicate that a Coroutine's ID is not
/// set.  This must be a negative value, so the most-significant bit must be
/// set.  In NanoOs, we only use 8 processes, so a value of -8 will work fine
/// for us.  Also, in the MemoryManager library, we use 4 bits to store the ID
/// of the owner, so this is an appropriate value.
