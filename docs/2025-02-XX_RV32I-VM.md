# XX-Feb-2025 - RV32I VM

I spent about a day working with [Claude](https://claude.ai) on a VM for the RV32I instruction set architecture.  It was at least an order of magnitude simpler than trying to implement a VM for WASM.  There are really only two memory segments to manage:  Physical Memory and Mapped Memory.  Of that, only physical memory was super critical.  I do have to be able to handle both in the VM eventually, but most of what's needed only requires physical memory.
